.. _sec_hardware_platforms:

Recommended Hardware
--------------------

This module may be evaluated using the sliceKIT Modular Development Platform, available from digikey. Required board SKUs are:

   * XP-SKC-L16 (sliceKIT L2 Core Board) plus one or two XA-SK-ISBUS slice and XA-SK-XTAG2 (sliceKIT XTAG adapter) 

Demonstration Applications
--------------------------

A ``LIN Bus Master/Slave Loopback demo`` application is available which demonstrates how the module is used to transmit and receive LIN frames and can be found in the xSOFTip Explorer pane. It supports either a single node (master only) or dual nodes (master and slave) running concurrently on the same multi-core device.
